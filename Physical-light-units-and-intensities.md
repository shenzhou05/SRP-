## Light units

HD render pipeline allows you to set your lights intensities using physical light units. 

Depending on the light type we offer different unit options in order to give you the most relevant options.

### Candelas

Candelas describe the luminous intensity of visible in a certain direction. It is based on the fact that a candle emits light with a luminous intensity of 1 candela in all directions.

### Lumens

Lumens are commonly used to describe the luminous flux of visible light emitted by omnidirectional light sources. It is very common to see a mention of the luminous power of a light bulb in lumens on the packaging in stores.

### Luminance

### EV

### Lux



## __Natural light levels__

| Illuminance       | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 120 000 lux       | Very bright sunlight                        |
| 110 000 lux       | Bright sunlight                             |
| 20 000 lux        | Blue sky lighting at midday                 |
| 1 000 - 2 000 lux | Overcast sky lighting at midday             |
| < 1 lux           | Moonlight, clear night sky                  |
| 0.002 lux         | Starry night without moon including airglow |

## Artificial lights intensities (in lumens)

Rough orders of magnitude in usual day life light intensities.

| Luminous flux     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12.57 lm          | Candle light                                                 |
| < 100 lm          | Small decorative light (I.E. small LED lamp)                 |
| 200 - 300 lm      | Decorative lamp ( does not provide main lighting for a bright room ) |
| 400 - 800 lm      | Ceiling lamp for a regular room                              |
| 800 - 1 200 lm    | Ceiling lamp for a large brightly lit room                   |
| 1 000 - 40 000 lm | Street light                                                 |

## __Indoors light levels (usual recommendations for architects)__

These are the light levels recommended in the areas where a person would be the most in certain rooms. For instance 

| Illuminance         | Room type               |
| ------------------- | :---------------------- |
| 150 - 300 lux       | Bedroom                 |
| 300 - 500 lux       | Classroom               |
| 300 - 750 lux       | Kitchen                 |
| 300 - 500 lux       | Counter or Office       |
| 100 - 300 lux       | Bathroom                |
| 750 lux - 1 000 lux | Supermarket interior    |
| 30 lux              | City street at night    |
| 750 lux             | Drawing board           |
| 200 - 500 lux       | Football or Rugby field |
