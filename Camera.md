# Camera

**Cameras** are the devices that capture and display the world to the player. By customizing and manipulating cameras, you can make the presentation of your game truly unique. You can have an unlimited number of cameras in a scene. They can be set to render in any order, at any place on the screen, or only certain parts of the screen.

This is the HD version of the camera used in **Hight Definition Render Pipeline**. You can see it by the component HDAdditionalCameraData. Note that even if displayed here, some camera's elements will be in HDAdditionalCameraData when you use camera in scripts.

You can basically find same elements than in a [Standard Unity Camera](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/class-Camera.html) but they have been sorted by their purpose.
