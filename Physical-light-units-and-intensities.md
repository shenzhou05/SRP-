# Physical Light units

Lighting in HDRP uses Physical Light Units (PLU). These units are based on real-life light measurements like those taken from a photographic light meter, or the measurements you see on light bulbs at the store.

### Candelas

A [Candela](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela) is a unit of measurement used to describe the luminous intensity of visible light in a given direction. For example, an average candle emits light with a luminous intensity of 1 candela in all directions.

### Lumens

[Lumens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumen_(unit)) are commonly used to describe the luminous flux of visible light emitted by omnidirectional light sources. You can often see references to the luminous power of light bulbs in lumens on the packaging.

### Luminance

[Luminance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminance) is a measurement of the luminous intensity per unit area of light travelling in a given direction. It describes the amount of light that passes through, is emitted, or reflected from a particular area.

### Lux

Lux is the derived unit of [illuminance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminance) and [luminous emittance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_emittance), measuring [luminous flux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminous_flux) per unit area. One lux is equal to one lumen per square metre.

## __Natural light levels__

These are light measurements from natural sources in different conditions:

| Illuminance       | Description                                 |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 120 000 lux       | Very bright sunlight                        |
| 110 000 lux       | Bright sunlight                             |
| 20 000 lux        | Blue sky lighting at midday                 |
| 1 000 - 2 000 lux | Overcast sky lighting at midday             |
| < 1 lux           | Moonlight, clear night sky                  |
| 0.002 lux         | Starry night without moon, including airglow |

## Artificial light intensities (in lumens)

These are approximate light measurements from artificial sources:

| Luminous flux     | Description                                                  |
| ----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 12.57 lm          | Candle light                                                 |
| < 100 lm          | Small decorative light (I.E. small LED lamp)                 |
| 200 - 300 lm      | Decorative lamp ( does not provide main lighting for a bright room ) |
| 400 - 800 lm      | Ceiling lamp for a regular room                              |
| 800 - 1 200 lm    | Ceiling lamp for a large brightly lit room                   |
| 1 000 - 40 000 lm | Street light                                                 |

## __Indoors light levels (usual recommendations for architects)__

These values are used by architects when they design rooms and buildings for functional use:

| Illuminance         | Room type               |
| ------------------- | :---------------------- |
| 150 - 300 lux       | Bedroom                 |
| 300 - 500 lux       | Classroom               |
| 300 - 750 lux       | Kitchen                 |
| 300 - 500 lux       | Counter or Office       |
| 100 - 300 lux       | Bathroom                |
| 750 lux - 1 000 lux | Supermarket interior    |
| 30 lux              | City street at night    |
| 750 lux             | Drawing board           |
| 200 - 500 lux       | Football or Rugby field |
