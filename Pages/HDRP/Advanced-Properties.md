High Definition Render Pipeline (HDRP) components expose standard properties by default that are suitable for most use-cases. To fine-tune the behavior of your components, you can manually expose **Advanced Properties** .

## Exposing Advanced Properties

Components that include advanced properties have a plus icon to the right of each property section header. Click this plus icon to expose the advanced properties for that property section. For example, the [Light componentâ€™s](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ScriptableRenderPipeline/wiki/Light-Component) **General** section includes advanced properties:

When you click the plus icon, Unity exposes the advanced properties for the **General** section. In this example,  the **Light Layer** property appears:
